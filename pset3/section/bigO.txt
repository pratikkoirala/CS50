Big O

    - Think of Big O notation like this:
        -   You want to determine the worst cast running time of an algorithm, suppressing lower order terms
            and constant factors. This is because, as the data size, n, gets extremely large, nothing but the
            highest order term is going to matter. 
            
        -   Concretely, for some sufficiently large number m as input size, if I can choose a function f(m) that
            when multipled by a constant factor will ALWAYS be larger than the fuction in question, we can
            say that the function in question runs in O(f(m)) time, since f(m) provides an upper bounds for our
            function.
