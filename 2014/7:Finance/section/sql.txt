SQL

creating tables - 

    CREATE my_table;

    - primary key (means you can't have 2 in the table). The reason you want
      ID to be the primary key is because you might have identical usernames
      or something, so you want to specify a row by a value you are auto-
      incrementing (such that it'll never be the same and never return multiple
      rows)
      
    - we'll also make 'username' a unique key (we'll check later on if a 
      username is taken and if it is, we won't allow another user to duplicate
      it)
      
    - Unique and Primary identifiers are very similar, the main difference 
      being you can have multiple unique identifiers but only one primary key
