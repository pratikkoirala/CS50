pseudocode-

    while(start <= end)
        if (what I'm looking for = mid)
            return position;
        else if (what I'm looking for is less than mid)
            end = mid - 1;
        else
            start = mid + 1;
        

Binary Search runs, in the best case, in constant time: Omega(1)

In the worst case, Binary Search will take log(n) operations - this makes sense if you think
about what Binary Search is doing: every time you re-enter the loop, you are halving the size
of the problem.
    -   From a mathematical standpoint log(n) base 2 means 2 to the power of what gives you n, or
        2^x = n
