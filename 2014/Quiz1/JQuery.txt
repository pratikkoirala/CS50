JQuery is simply a Javascript library that's supposed to help simplfy and streamline certain functions.


The '$' signifies JQuery (don't be confused with its usage in PHP where it identifies a variable!)


$("#id"); $("tag"); $(".class");

the '.' is like a function called on some object, element, etc

$(document).ready()  -  a JQuery function that basically checks whether the page's DOM has fully loaded.
                       The reason you do this is because when a page runs, it's basically going to run
                       sequentially, from top to bottom (basically). Let's say you are altering some part
                       of the DOM in your JQuery, well that call is probably going to be at the top of your
                       code in a <head> tag, which means when it runs if you fail to make sure the DOM is ready
                       you're going to be trying to alter a DOM that's not there.
                      
                       // function here is some anonymous function
                       $(document).ready(function() {
                      
                         // code
                      
                       });

$("#someID")         -  this is the exact same as the JS call document.getElementById("someID"). So, for example,
                        if I have some html tag like:
                      
                            <div id="SB">
                                <p>Attaining the Ballmer Peak</p>       
                            </div>
                            
                       then a call to $("someID") will return: <p>Attaining the Ballmer Peak</p>, or basically,
                       some DOM element.
                      
$("#someID").html() - get the HTML of some DOM element (the same as document.getElementById.innerHTML) So, where the above is going to return a DOM element, calling
                      html() on it will return "<p>Attaining the Ballmer Peak</p>"

html("string")      - in order to change the HTML

.submit()           - called when a form element is submitted.

.val()              - will get whatever value was in a select or text area, so a call like $("someID").submit(function () { var value = $("name").val(); }); will
                      get the DOM element with id = "someID" (probably a form); when this form is submitted (detected with .submit()) I then want to call an
                      anonymous function where in a variable called 'value' I store whatever val() was inputted into the textarea in the form.

return false        - will call three separate functions (1) event.preventDefault() - so, let's say I have a link to a webpage, if in my JS I reference that link
                      and then return false (preventDefault) that link will no longer redirect. (2) event.stopPropagation() - prevent parent handlers from being 
                      notified of an event firing. (3) stop callback execution
