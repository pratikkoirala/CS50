                                       [Expectations]
                                       
While teaching CS50 can be fun, there are some standards we expect all our TFs
to adhere to:

    1. We expect all our TFs to attend their sections, at least one OHs a week,
       TF training in the Fall, staff meetings, all grading parties, 
       the Hackathon, and the Fair.
       
    2. We expect our TFs to be accessible to their students outside of class.
       Whether that means responding to emails, calls, or answering questions
       on Discuss, the help you provide students outside the classroom is just
       as important as the time you spend with them in section and at OHs.
       
    3. We expect you to prepare and be ready to teach your section every week.
    
    4. We expect you to return all psets in a timely manner so students can 
       learn from and improve upon past mistakes. 

    5. If, for any reason, you can't make it to your scheduled OHs, we expect
       you to find a replacement and let heads know.
       
    6. And finally, we want everyone to have a great time; some of the people 
       you'll meet this semester will become friends of yours for the rest of
       college. We realize we ask a lot, so if at any time you feel overwhelmed, 
       let us know so we can help.
