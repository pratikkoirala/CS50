As always, with this many students and TFs there will undoubtedly be some 
hiccups. Some of the most frequent problems are:

    -   grading psets on time
    -   handling student anxiety 
    -   making it to everything! (sections, staff meetings, OHs, etc) 

In case of trouble, if you're a first year TF the first person you should go to 
is your Mentor. We've paired everyone up in a Mentor/Mentee relationship; so, 
if you're new, you'll have someone to show you the ropes! Mentors will help
give guidance at OHs, provide feedback on sections, and be available should
any problems arise first year TFs might feel unsure how to handle. 

If anything big comes up, though, like you're unable to finish grading psets 
or if you have to miss a scheduled meeting, you can always reach heads at
heads@cs50.harvard.edu!
