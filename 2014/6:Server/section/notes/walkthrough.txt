FUNCTIONS

    getopt() - just checking what kind of flags are passed in via the
               command line. If you pass in a port with "-p", this number
               gets assigned to port. Otherwise, the program will normally
               prompt for correct usage then close.
               
    start() - This is a function we create to start a server. It makes use,
              extensively, of sockets

SOCKETS

  servers -
    A socket is simply a way for a client and a server to connect and communicate.
    When we are setting up a server in start(), I'm (1) creating a socket, then
    (2) binding that socket to an address, and (3) listening for connections
    from a client. When a connection is made, the server (4) accepts the connection,
    as done in connected(), and then information can pass between the client and the
    server. The listening descriptor is a server side descriptor that is usually only
    made once and can last for the entirety of the progrm. The connected descriptor
    that returns after a call to accept() exists only as long as it takes for the server
    to service a client request. (remember our HTTP model!)

  clients -
    (1) create a socket, and then (2) connect it to the server
