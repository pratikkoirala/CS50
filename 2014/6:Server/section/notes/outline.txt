Outline

    1) Go over the internet
        - Have a student, when I'm done, explain to me everything that happens
          when I open a page like facebook.com
    
    2) Now that students understand a bit of how the internet works, go over 
       the hypertext in HTTP (which is HTML - hypertext markup language)
        - code the Halloween page, then have students spend some time
          creating their own pages
          
        - getting this to work, run into a permission error (a HTTP 403 code).
          Use this to transition into a discussion about chmod.
          
        - open up developer tools on your page and view some of the requests you 
          just talked about

    3) Students should understand what happens both as a client and a server when
       a request is made. They should also understand some of the information (hypertext)
       that is being passed back and forth, which makes pages nowadays so awesome.
        - go over the pset spec
            - the general flow
            - hard to understand function
            - sockets
