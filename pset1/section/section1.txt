        Introduction
            -   Be excited!!! This is your first section!
            
            -   Introduce yourself, the class, what students can expect from section.
                -   Although not necessary, alot of TFs give out their phone numbers along with
                    their email addresses. Just try to be accessible and welcoming, for many this
                    is their first CS class ever! 
                    
            -   Mention some of the resources we have for students ,i.e. Walkthroughs, Shorts, 
                Study50, etc
                * Note: Sections are a time to dive in and get some hands on experience with topics
                        mentioned in class or in study materials, as such, it's expected students
                        meet us half way! By coming to section having watched the lectures, read
                        the pset spec, and thought about the problems, students will be able to get
                        the most our of their time in section.
            
            -   Quickly go over grading! Stress that comments are just as important, if not more so,
                than the actual score! Reading comments is how students will improve.

        Arrays
            -   How do you make arrays?
                -   <datatype> <name>[<size>];
                -   char alpha[26];
                -   int score[5];   

            -   To initialize an array, simply index into that array starting at 0:
                -   int score[0] = 0; // zero index all arrays!
                    int score[1] = 1;
                    int score[2] = 2;
                -   int score[] - {1, 2, 3}; /* if you leave out the size of the array here, it will simply
                                                create an array based on the number of entries. */
