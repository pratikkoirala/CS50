        Introduction
            -   Be excited!!! This is your first section!
            
            -   Introduce yourself, the class, what students can expect from section.
                -   Although not necessary, alot of TFs give out their phone numbers along with
                    their email addresses. Just try to be accessible and welcoming, for many this
                    is their first CS class ever! 
                    
            -   Mention some of the resources we have for students ,i.e. Walkthroughs, Shorts, 
                Study50, etc
                * Note: Sections are a time to dive in and get some hands on experience with topics
                        mentioned in class or in study materials, as such, it's expected students
                        meet us half way! By coming to section having watched the lectures, read
                        the pset spec, and thought about the problems, students will be able to get
                        the most our of their time in section.
            
            -   Quickly go over grading! Stress that comments are just as important, if not more so,
                than the actual score! Reading comments is how students will improve.

        Arrays
            -   How do you make arrays?
                -   <datatype> <name>[<size>];
                    -   char alpha[26];
                    -   int score[5];   

            -   To initialize an array, simply index into that array starting at 0:
                -   int score[0] = 0; // zero index all arrays!
                    int score[1] = 1;
                    int score[2] = 2;
                -   int score[] - {1, 2, 3}; /* if you leave out the size of the array here, it will simply
                                                create an array based on the number of entries. */

            /* POSSIBLE TASK - HAVE EVERYONE CREATE AN ARRAY, THEN ITERATE OVER ITS MEMBERS */

            -   Although we can use the "string" declaration to declare strings, "strings" are really
                just arrays of characters.
                -   So, if I declare some string s = "bowden fever"; then I can index into this like any
                    other array.
                    -   s[0] = 'b';
                    -   s[1] = 'o'; /* if I were to do something like s[12], which is one past strlen(s), I 
                                       would get the terminating character '\0'. */
                                       
            /* POSSIBLE TASK - HAVE EVERYONE CREATE A STRING, THEN PRINT IT OUT, LETTER BY LETTER */

        Functions
            -   Functions (1) take something in [parameters], (2) do something [methods], and
                finally [3] spit out an answer [return value].         
                
            -   Why do we want functions?
                -   They allow us to minimize the amount of code we need to write. If, say, I wrote a function
                    bool isRob(string s) to tell me, true/false, whether a string is equivalent to "Rob", I
                    only need to write that function once - in the future I can just refer to this function 
                    to test strings without having to repeatedly code the same thing.
                        
            -   One function everyone has seen already is int main(void)
                -   int is the return type
                -   main is the name of the function (every program needs a main() function - it signifies to
                    the computer where to start running your code)
                -   void is the parameter, which, in this case, is nothing
                        
            -   Something you have to mention is scope
                -   If I have a program like scope.c, this will print out 5, because the scope of the 2nd pair 
                    of inner paratheses refers to the a defined within its bounds.
