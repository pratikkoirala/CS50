Things students should feel comfortable with before attempting pset2:

    -   First thing students will see is a change in their main(void) function
        - in place of (void), there will be (int argc, char* argv[]). argc is how many
          arguments are passed to the program, while argv[] is an array containing the strings 
          passed in as arguments. 
              If I run "./caesar 2", then argc = 2, and argv will be an array containing
              2 strings, "./caesar" and "2".
          
    -   Students should understand what modulo (%) does and why it's important
        - n%d returns the remainder of n/d where n and d are both integers. 
        - modulo is important because it restricts the max number attainable,
          for example, if I have the alphabet stored in some array of chars,
          let's call it "char alpha[26]", then I never want to index into that 
          array past position 25 (since all arrays are 0 indexed). I can do this
          by always mod'ing the index by 26:
              alpha[0%26] -> 'a';
              alhpa[5%26] -> 'f';
              alpha[25%26] -> 'z';
              alpha[26%26] -> 'a';
              alpha[100%26] -> 'w';
        - See "mod.c"

    -   Arrays are sequential, contiguous blocks of memory. This makes indexing into them fast
        because it is very easy for the computer to know exactly where to go to grab the next
        piece of data (unlike linked lists, which we will get to later).
            
    -   So, let's say I declare a char array[16]; this is going to set aside 16 bytes of contiguous 
        memory. Let's say I then declare another array, this time an int array[10];
        this will set aside 40 bytes of contiguous memory (each int is 4 bytes).

    -   Students whould realize that strings are really just arrays of characters, so I can index 
        into a string like I can index into any array.
        - string s = "Rob";
        - printf(%c%c%c\n", s[0], s[1], s[2]);
              Output: Rob
                
/** This part gets into pointers and memory allocation - can be skipped for less comfy sections **/

    -   Well then, what's the difference between char*, string, and char[]?
        - char* and string are exactly the same. Something like char* s = "Hello"
          will place the string "Hello" into the read-only part of memory with the pointer
          s pointing to it. Because of this, strings (and char*) are immutable - they can't be
          changed. If you try to change a string after it has been declared, you'll segfault.
              string str1 = "hello";
              str1[0] = 'w'; // segfault

        - char[] will, instead, set aside memory on the stack, meaning you can change its 
          contents.
              char str2[5] = "hello";
              str2[0] = 'w'; // no problem, str2 is now "wello"
