Concepts students should feel comfortable with before attempting pset1:

    -   The concept of conditions (if, else)
        - format: if(condition is true)
                    "do something"
                  else
                    "do something else"

    -   The concept of iteration/ recursion
        - Although you only really need iteration to successfully complete pset1,
          it's not a bad idea to indroduce students to a basic recursive example.
        
        - For example, let's say I want to sum the numbers of an array:
            - see sum.c   
                            
        - Likewise, what's the advantage to solving a problem recursively? What's the
          advantage to solving a problem iteratively?
            - Some problems just naturally lend themselves to a recursive solution
              (i.e. Mergesort)
            - In many instances, it makes sense to break up a large problem into smaller,
              more manageable chunks, in which case recursion is better.
            - Recursion is more elegant.
            - Iteration is more straightforward. 
            - Recursion can use up much more of the stack, as each call to itself produces
              a new stack frame.
              
         - Which should you use? 
            - In this course, you will probably only ever have to use what feels comfortable.
              We may ask for a simple, recursive implementation of an algorthim on an exam,
              but as far as psets go, iteration will suffice.

        - What kind of iterative loops are there?
            - while loop:
                - while(condition)
                    "do something"
            - for loop
                - for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement)
                    "do something"
            - do-while loop
                do{
                    "do something at least one time, regardless of condition"
                  } while (condition); 

        - How to use command line arguments
            - int argc 
                - the number of arguments entered
            - string argv[] 
                - an array of those arguments
