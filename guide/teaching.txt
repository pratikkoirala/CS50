And now the bread and butter of the guide! In the rest of the guide, we'll 
define what your goals for each section should be, as well as outline short 
lesson plans to help focus your teaching. 

Although we're giving you a blueprint, it is by no means meant to limit your 
own teaching style. If you want to focus more on certain topics than others, 
by all means go ahead! If you want to use your own code examples then do it! If 
you're a senior TF and feel like what you're doing works then, if it ain't broke 
don't fix it! The following pages are simply meant to provide clear and concise 
goals and examples for TFs who might need them.

In general, the first page will outline the goals of the section, which are
basically what the student should know and be able to do once section is over.

Next, in a couple of pages we'll give you a lesson plan, full of important 
topics to cover, code examples, and helpful things to point out to students 
before they attempt that week's pset.
