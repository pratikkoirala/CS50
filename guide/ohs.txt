Probably the highlight of everyone's experience is Office Hours. Every week,
for three action-packed hours, TFs, CAs, and students all collide to tackle 
the week's pset. We've tried multiple approaches in the past, like electronic 
queues people sign into and then are popped out of, but what we've discovered
is the best way to handle office hours is to keep it organic. 

At Office Hours, there will be a couple of greeters who will assign you and
your Mentor/Mentee to a table, and it will then be your job to float (lol)
around the table, spending a little time with each student. We don't want you
to get tied down and spend 20-30 minutes at a time with a particular student
because it's not really fair to others. If you're assigned OHs on Thursday, 
for example, it gets pretty tense as everyone races to finish their psets; you 
want to make sure you get to everyone who needs help and not let one or two
students monopolize your time.

This inevitably leads to a bit of conflict as students want you around (you
are fabulous, after all!) and you'll have to manage your time and, sometimes, 
delicately detach yourself from clingy-er attendees. The best strategy is to 
(1) give them a little help and tell them to try and solve the problem and 
you'll be back and (2) explain that other students need help, and it's only 
fair you meet with everyone.

Outside of this, though, there aren't many downsides! Unless, of course, you
aren't into tons of cookies and brownies and fun (I'm looking at you Rob...)
