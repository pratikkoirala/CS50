Ohai! Welcome to CS50! Be prepared to become one of the most popular kids in 
your dining hall =)

TF'ing CS50 can be hard, but it's also incredibly rewarding. Over the semester, 
prepare for long nights at office hours, challenging questions during sections,
and best of all, lots and lots of candy ALL THE TIME.

This guide is meant to provide some guidance for many of you for whom this is 
your first year teaching. In it, you can find links to useful teaching and
scheduling resources, advice on how to handle potential problems, as well as 
short lesson plans for each section. We hope this'll be your go to place for
information about TF'ing!

Of course, though, if you have any outstanding questions, you're always welcome 
to ask your mentor. And, if all else fails, email heads! we get lonely when you
don't talk to us...

- heads <3
